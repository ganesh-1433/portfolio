# My Portfolio

### üë§ About Me

I am Ganesh Pawar, a pre-final year Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Data Science at Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering. Currently, I serve as the Technical Head for both the Data Science Students Association and the Geeks for Geeks Student Chapter at LTCoE, where I actively contribute to technical growth and community engagement.

My journey into Data Science began during high school when I first explored Python. What started as simple coding soon transformed into a deep fascination with data-driven insights and intelligent systems. Discovering how raw data could unveil meaningful patterns and influence decision-making sparked my passion for AI and ML‚Äîa curiosity that continues to shape my academic and professional path.

### üíº Projects

#### 1. **Data Leakage Detection System using Morse Code**

A PHP-MySQL-based security system designed to detect and prevent unauthorized data leaks. It employs a Morse code-based passkey mechanism, where users must enter a secure alphanumeric passkey, encoded in Morse code. If guessed incorrectly twice, access is blocked. Built with XAMPP, it integrates admin-controlled user management, transaction monitoring, and secure file transfers. The system ensures data confidentiality and integrity, leveraging Morse code as an additional encryption layer, making it ideal for organizations handling sensitive information.

#### 2. **Online Voting System**

A secure and transparent Python-based platform designed to facilitate digital elections with integrity. Built using Flask, SQLite, and Cryptography, it ensures end-to-end encryption, voter authentication, and tamper-proof voting records. The system incorporates Hashing (SHA-256) for vote integrity and OTP-based authentication for security. With an intuitive Tkinter or web-based UI, it enables seamless voting while preventing fraud. Scalable and efficient, this project is ideal for institutional and organizational elections, ensuring accessibility and trust in digital democracy.

#### 3. **Morse Code Trainer**

Morse Code Trainer is a Python-based interactive learning tool designed to teach Morse code efficiently. Built using Flask and Tkinter, it enables real-time encoding and decoding of Morse Code. The system provides adaptive training modules and interactive exercises to enhance learning. It supports text-to-Morse and Morse-to-text conversion, allowing users to practice with customizable difficulty levels. Leveraging NumPy and Matplotlib, it visualizes Morse patterns for better understanding. Scalable and extensible, this project can be adapted for secure communication, assistive technology, and cryptographic applications.
